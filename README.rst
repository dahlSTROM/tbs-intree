 **The purpose of this git repo is to compile TurboSight drivers directly into a Debian stock kernel, or a vanilla kernel, thus avoiding the use of a v4l tree and gain stability.**

 **Currently supported: 6680**

 **You can use it with kernel version 3.13.x and up.**
 
 **NOTE:** Kernels 3.1.8.x and up are currently unsupported due to a bug in tbs6680fe_driver.o_shipped.
